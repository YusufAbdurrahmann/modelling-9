# 🔢 Modelling – Learning Notes (By Yusuf Abdurrahman)

> *"A model is only as good as the assumptions behind it. Choose wisely, evaluate rigorously."*

## 📘 What I Learned in Modelling

In this project, I explored the key concepts and steps involved in building, evaluating, and refining machine learning models:

---

### 1. ⚙️ Model Selection

Choosing the appropriate algorithm(s) based on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.), data size, and interpretability requirements.

**Why it matters:**  
Different models have different strengths. Selecting the right one sets the foundation for achieving high performance.

---

### 2. 📐 Model Training

Training involves feeding data into the selected algorithm so it can learn patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs.

**Why it matters:**  
A well-trained model captures the underlying structure of the data and makes accurate predictions on unseen data.

---

### 3. 🧪 Model Evaluation

Evaluation uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and RMSE to assess how well the model performs on validation/test data.

**Why it matters:**  
Evaluating with the right metrics ensures you understand the model's strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for the task.

---

### 4. ⚖️ Bias–Variance Tradeoff

Balancing underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) to achieve optimal generalization performance.

**Why it matters:**  
Understanding this tradeoff helps in selecting model complexity and improving predictive performance on unseen data.

---

### 5. 🔁 Cross-Validation

A method for assessing how well a model generalizes by training and testing on different subsets of the data.

**Why it matters:**  
Cross-validation reduces the risk of overfitting to a single train-test split and provides a more reliable performance estimate.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Modelling turns prepared data into predictive insights.
- Each step in the modelling pipeline is critical for building robust, accurate, and interpretable machine learning models.
